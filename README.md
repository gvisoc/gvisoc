### Hi there 👋

Welcome!

My name is Gabriel, I am a Software Architect from Spain, and I moved to Australia in 2017.

- 🐧 I am consistently using Linux since 1997 in some capacity, and exclusively since 2020. I use Fedora at the moment.
- ☕ I mainly use Java to proof concepts before applying them at work or in my personal projects.
- 🐍 I also like to play with Python and other languages, but at a much lower level.
- 💎 I use Jekyll to publish stuff at my blogs.
- 👋 I am on Mastodon! Say hi back and know more at <a rel="me" href="https://aus.social/@gvisoc">@gvisoc@aus.social</a>
